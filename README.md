# Elastic-SIEM-Lab
# PROJECTNAME

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Elastic Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis via nmap by using Kali Linux Virtual Box (VM) for capturing network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
